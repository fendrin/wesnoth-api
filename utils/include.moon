-- File/directory inclusions
--
-- Syntax: {path}
--
-- Includes the file with the specified path, which will in turn run the preprocessor on it and perform any required substitutions or inclusions within it.
-- The path may not contain .. or the inclusion will be skipped.
--
-- The exact location in which the path will be resolved will depend on its prefix:
--
-- {path}: If path isn't a known macro (see below), the game will assume it's a relative path to a file in the main game data/ directory and include it.
-- {~path}: As above, but instead of the game data directory, the path is resolved relative to the user data/ directory, where user made add-ons can normally be found.
-- {./path}: The path is resolved relative to the location of the current file containing this inclusion.
--
-- Information for locating the user data and game data directories can be found in EditingWesnoth.
--
-- Forward slashes (/) should always be used as the path delimiter, even if your platform uses a different symbol such as colons (:) or backslashes (\)!
-- It is also very important to respect the actual letter case used to name files and directories for compatibility with case-sensitive filesystems on Unix-based operating systems.
--
-- When path points to a directory instead of a file, the preprocessor will include all files found within with the .cfg extension, in alphabetical order;
-- files without this extension (such as .map or .png files) are ignored.
--
-- Some directories are handled in a special fashion according to their contents:
--
-- If there's a file named _main.cfg in the target directory, only that file will be included and preprocessed.
-- It may include other files from its own directory or subdirectories within it, of course.
-- This is used for managing WML directories as self-contained packages, like user made add-ons.
-- If there are files named _main.cfg in subdirectories of the target and there isn't one in the target itself, they will be all preprocessed. Given the following layout:
--
-- dir/
-- dir/a/_main.cfg
-- dir/a/other.cfg
-- dir/b/_main.cfg
-- dir/b/other.cfg
-- dir/other.cfg
--
-- Using {dir} will cause dir/a/_main.cfg, dir/b/_main.cfg and dir/other.cfg to be included.
--
-- If there's a file named _final.cfg but no _main.cfg, the file is guaranteed to be included and processed after all the other files in the directory.
-- If there's a file named _initial.cfg but no _main.cfg, the file is guaranteed to be included and processed before all the other files in the directory.

-- _main.wsl is processed first
-- _final.wsl is processed last if no _main.wsl
